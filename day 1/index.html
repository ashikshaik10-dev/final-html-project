            <p>F1 (marketed as F1 The Movie) is a 2025 American sports drama film starring Brad Pitt as Formula
                One (F1)
                racing driver Sonny Hayes, who returns after a 30-year absence to save his former teammate's
                underdog
                team, APXGP, from collapse. The film was directed by Joseph Kosinski from a screenplay by Ehren
                Kruger.
                Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Javier Bardem also star in supporting roles.

                Development of the film began in December 2021 with Pitt, Kosinski, Kruger, and producer Jerry
                Bruckheimer attached to the project; the latter three had previously collaborated on Top Gun:
                Maverick
                (2022). Supporting cast members were revealed in early 2023, before the start of principal
                photography
                at Silverstone that July. Filming also took place during Grand Prix weekends of the 2023 and
                2024 World
                Championships, with the collaboration of the FIA, the governing body of F1. Racing sequences
                were
                adapted from the real-life races, with F1 teams and drivers appearing throughout, including
                Lewis
                Hamilton, who was also a producer. Hans Zimmer composed the film's score, while numerous artists
                contributed to its soundtrack.

                F1 premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 16, 2025, and was released in the
                United
                States by Warner Bros. Pictures and Apple Original Films on June 27. The film received positive
                reviews
                from critics, became the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2025, and grossed $631.5 million
                worldwide
                against a $200–300 million budget. As of 2025, the film is also the highest-grossing auto racing
                film of
                all time, the highest-grossing film by Apple Studios, and the highest-grossing film of Pitt's
                career.
                The National Board of Review named it as one of the top ten films of the year.[6]</p>

                            <p>Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, who
                                co-wrote the
                                screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan. It features an ensemble cast led by Matthew
                                McConaughey,
                                Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a
                                dystopian future
                                where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group
                                of astronauts who
                                travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.

                                The screenplay had its origins in a script that Jonathan had developed in 2007 and was
                                originally set to
                                be directed by Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive
                                producer and
                                scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of
                                Interstellar. It was Lynda
                                Obst's final film as producer before her death. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot
                                it on 35 mm film
                                in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took
                                place in
                                Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature
                                effects, and the
                                company DNEG created additional visual effects.

                                Interstellar premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on October 26, 2014, and was released
                                in theaters in
                                the United States on November 5, and in the United Kingdom on November 7, with Paramount

                                international markets. In
                                the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using
                                digital projectors. It
                                was a commercial success, grossing $681 million worldwide during its initial theatrical
                                run, and $773.8
                                million worldwide with subsequent releases, making it the 10th-highest-grossing film of
                                2014. The film
                                received generally positive reviews from critics. Among its various accolades,
                                Interstellar was
